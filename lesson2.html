             <div class="ruleContent">
                 <p>The Rule of Thirds is an amazing principle to make websites look professional and eye-catching. Photography or photos play an incredible role in the appereance of a web page.</p>
                 <p>There are few rules that can help to take or show a great picture in this case the rule of thirds gives you an opportunity to show imgaes in a different point of view. In this exmaple on ALeks Website we can see how the main image follow the rule of thirds. the image is not completly center. instead we can apreciate how the face of the two actors are near to the upper left corner. This also Creates a sence of  an organize place with more space.</p>

            <div class="ruleContent"> <p>Pinterest is a great example when we talk about Proximity. Proximity is grouping items that are realted to each other. when we see separate items on a website, we can clearly know that they are not related or the dont have a relationship between them. Using the principle of proximity also creates a sence of organization in a web site or site.</p>
            <p> On this example we can clearly see how pinterest groups the information, so it will be easier for the user to see and decide what he wants to look at. we can see a section called: "Ideas for you" another one called "Popular on Pinteres" and the last one "Womens Fashion". Proximity is one the 5 Designing Principles that are important for every page or work to look professional and to have organization.</p></div>

         <h2>Use of white Space</h2>
         <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinMattpq/kevinmattpq.github.io/master/img/Screenshot_20210501-130609_Google.jpg" width="300px" alt="Example of white Space">
         <div class="ruleContent">
            <p>The use of white space in a website is fundamental to give a rest to the eyes. Sometimes when all the information is togeher it creates feeling that the page is not well organize and the there is too much information.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the use of white space also improves the user's experience. by improving the visual communication. On this example we can clearly see how the use of white space was applied, even in the buttons centering the text with a paddign all the way around. This page is showing the product and just one button in case you are interested on it. This helps to fully appreciate the product and creates an enviroment of organization.</p>
